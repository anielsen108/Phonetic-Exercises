# Coarticulation Study: /p/ + /s/

### Sequence: voiceless bilabial stop → voiceless alveolar fricative

### Example Phrase: **lapse**

**IPA:** `/læps/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[læps[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"lapse"** slowly and notice how **/p/** prepares for **/s/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from bilabial to alveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "lapse," then blend: "lapse."
* Freeze on the **/p/**: establish clear lips close, then feel the shift toward **/s/** (tongue tip near alveolar ridge).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/læps/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[læp̚s[`

  * **[p̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/s/** early, so **/p/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the bilabial articulation moves toward alveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Release economy:** **/p/** may go unreleased **[p̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/s/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "lapse" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/p/-/s/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/p/** and **/s/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /p/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often aspirated word-initially |
| Second | /s/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiceless | oral | continuous, high-energy |

* **/p/**: Released /p/ before fricative
* **/s/**: Voiceless alveolar fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

---

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /p/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between bilabial and alveolar articulations.

2. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /p/ closure releases directly into the /s/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Released /p/ before fricative

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /p/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /s/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"lapse"** slowly, establishing full /p/ articulation.
2. Say **"s"** starting with an isolated /s/.
3. Merge: *lapse* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/læps/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /p/ and /s/.
* Alternate "p-s-p-s" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | bilabial → alveolar                   | /p s/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiceless                | Common in /p s/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → fricative                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and fricative (sibilant) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /p/ + /s/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
