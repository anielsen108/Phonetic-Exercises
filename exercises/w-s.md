# Coarticulation Study: /w/ + /s/

### Sequence: labial-velar approximant → voiceless alveolar fricative

### Example Phrase: **now see**

**IPA:** `/naʊ si/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[naʊ si[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"now see"** slowly and notice how **/w/** prepares for **/s/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from labial-velar to alveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "now | see," then blend: "now‑see."
* Freeze on the **/w/**: establish clear lips round, tongue back raises, then feel the shift toward **/s/** (tongue tip near alveolar ridge).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/naʊ si/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[naʊ si[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/s/** early, so **/w/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the labial-velar articulation moves toward alveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "now see" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/w/** to **/s/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/w/** and **/s/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /w/ | labial-velar | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |
| Second | /s/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiceless | oral | continuous, high-energy |

* **/w/**: Labiovelar → alveolar fricative
* **/s/**: Voiceless alveolar fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /w/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between labial-velar and alveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Labiovelar → alveolar fricative

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /s/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"now"** slowly, establishing full /w/ articulation.
2. Say **"see"** starting with an isolated /s/.
3. Merge: *now see* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/naʊ si/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /w/ and /s/.
* Alternate "w-s-w-s" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | labial-velar → alveolar               | /w s/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /w s/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | approximant → fricative               | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving approximant and fricative (sibilant) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /w/ + /s/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
