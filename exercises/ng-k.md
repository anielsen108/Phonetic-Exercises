# Coarticulation Study: /ŋ/ + /k/

### Sequence: velar nasal → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **sing clearly**

**IPA:** `/sɪŋ kʰliɹli/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[sɪŋ kʰliɹli[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"sing clearly"** slowly and notice how **/ŋ/** flows into **/k/**. Both sounds share the same velar place of articulation, but differ in their manner, creating a smooth homorganic transition.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "sing | clearly," then blend: "sing‑clearly."
* Freeze on the **/ŋ/**: establish clear tongue back contacts soft palate, velum lowers, then feel the shift toward **/k/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/sɪŋ kʰliɹli/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[sɪŋ kʰliɹli[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/k/** early, so **/ŋ/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "sing clearly" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/ŋ/** to **/k/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/ŋ/** and **/k/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /ŋ/ | velar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/ŋ/**: Homorganic: velar nasal → velar stop
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

2. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Homorganic: velar nasal → velar stop

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Nasal formants          | Low F1 (~250 Hz), distinct nasal pole       | Nasal resonance quality         |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"sing"** slowly, establishing full /ŋ/ articulation.
2. Say **"clearly"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *sing clearly* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/sɪŋ kʰliɹli/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /ŋ/ and /k/.
* Alternate "ŋ-k-ŋ-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → velar                         | /ŋ k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /ŋ k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | nasal → stop                          | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving nasal and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /ŋ/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **voicing transition**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
