# Coarticulation Study: /r/ + /w/

### Sequence: alveolar approximant → labial-velar approximant

### Example Phrase: **her work**

**IPA:** `/hɚ wɝk/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[hɚ wɝk[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"her work"** slowly and notice how **/r/** prepares for **/w/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from postalveolar to labial-velar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "her | work," then blend: "her‑work."
* Freeze on the **/r/**: establish clear tongue bunches or curls, then feel the shift toward **/w/** (lips round, tongue back raises).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/hɚ wɝk/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[hɚ wɝk[`

  * **Coarticulation** = articulators prepare for **[w]** during **[r]**

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/w/** early, so **/r/** begins shifting toward the labial-velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the postalveolar articulation moves toward labial-velar, creating a smooth transition.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "her work" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/r/-/w/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/r/** and **/w/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /r/ | alveolar/postalveolar | approximant (rhotic) | voiced | oral | continuous, may be syllabic |
| Second | /w/ | labial-velar | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |

* **/r/**: Rhotic → labiovelar
* **/w/**: Labial-velar approximant articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the labial-velar target before the /r/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar/postalveolar and labial-velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /r/ and /w/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Rhotic → labiovelar

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /w/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"her"** slowly, establishing full /r/ articulation.
2. Say **"work"** starting with an isolated /w/.
3. Merge: *her work* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/hɚ wɝk/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /r/ and /w/.
* Alternate "r-w-r-w" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar/postalveolar → labial-velar  | /r w/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /r w/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | approximant → approximant             | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving approximant (rhotic) and approximant manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /r/ + /w/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
