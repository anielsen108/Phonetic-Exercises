# Coarticulation Study: /t/ + /dʒ/

### Sequence: voiceless alveolar stop → voiced postalveolar affricate

### Example Phrase: **at just**

**IPA:** `/æt̚ d͡ʒʌst/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[æt̚ d͡ʒʌst[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"at just"** slowly and notice how **/t/** prepares for **/dʒ/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from alveolar to postalveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "at | just," then blend: "at‑just."
* Freeze on the **/t/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, then feel the shift toward **/dʒ/** (tongue releases into ʒ).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/æt̚ d͡ʒʌst/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[æt̚̚ d͡ʒʌst̚[`

  * **[t̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/dʒ/** early, so **/t/** begins shifting toward the postalveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward postalveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiceless to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/t/** may go unreleased **[t̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/dʒ/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "at just" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/t/** to **/dʒ/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/t/** and **/dʒ/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /t/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often unreleased word-finally |
| Second | /dʒ/ | postalveolar | affricate | voiced | oral | stop + fricative sequence |

* **/t/**: Voiceless stop to voiced affricate: /dʒ/ partially devoiced [d̥͡ʒ̊]
* **/dʒ/**: Voiced postalveolar affricate articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the postalveolar target before the /t/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and postalveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /t/ closure releases directly into the /dʒ/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Voiceless stop to voiced affricate: /dʒ/ partially devoiced [d̥͡ʒ̊]

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /t/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /dʒ/                    | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"at"** slowly, establishing full /t/ articulation.
2. Say **"just"** starting with an isolated /dʒ/.
3. Merge: *at just* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/æt̚ d͡ʒʌst/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /t/ and /dʒ/.
* Alternate "t-dʒ-t-dʒ" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → postalveolar               | /t dʒ/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /t dʒ/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → affricate                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and affricate manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /t/ + /dʒ/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
