# Coarticulation Study: /dʒ/ + /m/

### Sequence: voiced postalveolar affricate → bilabial nasal

### Example Phrase: **judge me**

**IPA:** `/dʒʌdʒ mi/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[dʒʌdʒ mi[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"judge me"** slowly and notice how **/dʒ/** prepares for **/m/**. Your lips begin rounding or closing even while the tongue is still positioned for **/dʒ/**, creating a smooth articulatory overlap.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "judge | me," then blend: "judge‑me."
* Freeze on the **/dʒ/**: establish clear tongue releases into ʒ, then feel the shift toward **/m/** (lips close, velum lowers).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/dʒʌdʒ mi/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[dʒʌdʒ mi[`

  * **Coarticulation** = articulators prepare for **[m]** during **[dʒ]**

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/m/** early, so **/dʒ/** begins shifting toward the bilabial target.
* **Place assimilation:** the postalveolar articulation moves toward bilabial, creating a smooth transition.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "judge me" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/dʒ/-/m/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/dʒ/** and **/m/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /dʒ/ | postalveolar | affricate | voiced | oral | stop + fricative sequence |
| Second | /m/ | bilabial | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/dʒ/**: Affricate → bilabial nasal
* **/m/**: Bilabial nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the bilabial target before the /dʒ/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between postalveolar and bilabial articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /dʒ/ and /m/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Affricate → bilabial nasal

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /m/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"judge"** slowly, establishing full /dʒ/ articulation.
2. Say **"me"** starting with an isolated /m/.
3. Merge: *judge me* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/dʒʌdʒ mi/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /dʒ/ and /m/.
* Alternate "dʒ-m-dʒ-m" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | postalveolar → bilabial               | /dʒ m/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /dʒ m/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | affricate → nasal                     | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving affricate and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /dʒ/ + /m/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
