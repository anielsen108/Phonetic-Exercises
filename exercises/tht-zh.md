## Practice Exercises

### Example 1
**Phrase:** at measure
**IPA:** `//æt̚ ˈmɛʒəɹ///`

**Notes:** Practice the transition across word boundaryFocus on the transition from voiceless dental fricative + voiceless alveolar stop to voiced postalveolar fricative.

### Example 2
**Phrase:** it vision
**IPA:** `//ɪt̚ ˈvɪʒən///`

**Notes:** Practice the transition across word boundaryPractice in connected speech across word boundaries.
