# Coarticulation Study: /r/ + /n/

### Sequence: alveolar approximant → alveolar nasal

### Example Phrase: **born**

**IPA:** `/bɔɹn/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bɔɹn[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /r/ | alveolar/postalveolar | approximant (rhotic) | voiced | oral | continuous, may be syllabic |
| Second | /n/ | alveolar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/r/**: Rhotic → alveolar nasal
* **/n/**: Alveolar nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /r/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar/postalveolar and alveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /r/ and /n/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Rhotic → alveolar nasal

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /n/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"born"** slowly, establishing full /r/ articulation.
2. Say **"n"** starting with an isolated /n/.
3. Merge: *born* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bɔɹn/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /r/ and /n/.
* Alternate "r-n-r-n" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar/postalveolar → alveolar      | /r n/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /r n/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | approximant → nasal                   | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving approximant (rhotic) and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /r/ + /n/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
