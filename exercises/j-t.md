# Coarticulation Study: /j/ + /t/

### Sequence: palatal approximant → voiceless alveolar stop

### Example Phrase: **my turn**

**IPA:** `/maɪ tʰɝn/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[maɪ tʰɝn[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"my turn"** slowly and notice how **/j/** prepares for **/t/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from palatal to alveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "my | turn," then blend: "my‑turn."
* Freeze on the **/j/**: establish clear tongue front raises toward hard palate, then feel the shift toward **/t/** (tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/maɪ tʰɝn/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[maɪ tʰɝn[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/t/** early, so **/j/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the palatal articulation moves toward alveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "my turn" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/j/** to **/t/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/j/** and **/t/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /j/ | palatal | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |
| Second | /t/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often unreleased word-finally |

* **/j/**: Palatal → alveolar stop
* **/t/**: Voiceless alveolar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /j/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between palatal and alveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Palatal → alveolar stop

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /t/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"my"** slowly, establishing full /j/ articulation.
2. Say **"turn"** starting with an isolated /t/.
3. Merge: *my turn* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/maɪ tʰɝn/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /j/ and /t/.
* Alternate "j-t-j-t" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | palatal → alveolar                    | /j t/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /j t/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | approximant → stop                    | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving approximant and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /j/ + /t/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
