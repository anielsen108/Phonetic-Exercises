# Coarticulation Study: /g/ + /w/

### Sequence: voiced velar stop → labial-velar approximant

### Example Phrase: **big window**

**IPA:** `/bɪɡ̚ ˈwɪndoʊ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bɪɡ̚ ˈwɪndoʊ[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"big window"** slowly and notice how **/g/** prepares for **/w/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from velar to labial-velar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "big | window," then blend: "big‑window."
* Freeze on the **/g/**: establish clear tongue back contacts soft palate, then feel the shift toward **/w/** (lips round, tongue back raises).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/bɪɡ̚ ˈwɪndoʊ/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[bɪɡ̚ ˈwɪndoʊ[`

  * **[g̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/w/** early, so **/g/** begins shifting toward the labial-velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the velar articulation moves toward labial-velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Release economy:** **/g/** may go unreleased **[g̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/w/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "big window" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/g/-/w/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/g/** and **/w/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /g/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short, often reduced finally |
| Second | /w/ | labial-velar | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |

* **/g/**: Labialization anticipation
* **/w/**: Labial-velar approximant articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the labial-velar target before the /g/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between velar and labial-velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /g/ and /w/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /g/ closure releases directly into the /w/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Labialization anticipation

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /w/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"big"** slowly, establishing full /g/ articulation.
2. Say **"window"** starting with an isolated /w/.
3. Merge: *big window* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bɪɡ̚ ˈwɪndoʊ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /g/ and /w/.
* Alternate "g-w-g-w" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → labial-velar                  | /g w/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /g w/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → approximant                    | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and approximant manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /g/ + /w/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
