# Coarticulation Study: /s/ + /t/

### Sequence: voiceless alveolar fricative → voiceless alveolar stop

### Example Phrase: **last time**

**IPA:** `/læst̚ tʰaɪm/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[læst̚ tʰaɪm[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"last time"** slowly and notice how **/s/** flows into **/t/**. Both sounds share the same alveolar place of articulation, but differ in their manner, creating a smooth homorganic transition.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "last | time," then blend: "last‑time."
* Freeze on the **/s/**: establish clear tongue tip near alveolar ridge, then feel the shift toward **/t/** (tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/læst̚ tʰaɪm/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[læst̚ tʰaɪm[`

  * **[s̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/t/** early, so **/s/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "last time" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/s/-/t/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/s/** and **/t/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /s/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiceless | oral | continuous, high-energy |
| Second | /t/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often unreleased word-finally |

* **/s/**: Homorganic alveolar cluster
* **/t/**: Voiceless alveolar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Fricative-to-Stop Transition:**
   The continuous airflow of /s/ terminates as the /t/ closure forms. Listeners perceive a sharp acoustic boundary.

2. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Homorganic alveolar cluster

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /s/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Frication noise         | Continuous aperiodic energy                 | Distinct fricative quality      |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /t/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"last"** slowly, establishing full /s/ articulation.
2. Say **"time"** starting with an isolated /t/.
3. Merge: *last time* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/læst̚ tʰaɪm/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /s/ and /t/.
* Alternate "s-t-s-t" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → alveolar                   | /s t/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiceless                | Common in /s t/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → stop                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving fricative (sibilant) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /s/ + /t/ is a **mixed-voicing, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **fricative-to-stop transition**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
