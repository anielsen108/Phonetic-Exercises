# Coarticulation Study: /b/ + /k/

### Sequence: voiced bilabial stop → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **cab came**

**IPA:** `/kʰæb̥̚ kʰeɪm/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[kʰæb̥̚ kʰeɪm[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"cab came"** slowly and feel how **/b/** begins shifting toward **/k/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/b/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "cab | came," then blend: "cab‑came."
* Freeze on the **/b/**: establish clear lips close, then feel the shift toward **/k/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/kʰæb̥̚ kʰeɪm/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[kʰæb̥̚̚ kʰeɪm[`

  * **[b̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/k/** early, so **/b/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the bilabial articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/b/** may go unreleased **[b̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/k/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Say "cab came" with a big pause between **/b/** and **/k/** (fully releasing **/b/**). Then say it naturally without the pause. You'll hear how the release disappears in fluent speech.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/b/** and **/k/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /b/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short closure, often unreleased |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/b/**: Devoicing before /k/
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /b/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between bilabial and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Overlap:**
   The /b/ is typically unreleased ([b̚]), with air pressure maintained until the /k/ closure forms. The release burst belongs to /k/.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Devoicing before /k/

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"cab"** slowly, establishing full /b/ articulation.
2. Say **"came"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *cab came* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/kʰæb̥̚ kʰeɪm/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /b/ and /k/.
* Alternate "b-k-b-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | bilabial → velar                      | /b k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /b k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → stop                           | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /b/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
