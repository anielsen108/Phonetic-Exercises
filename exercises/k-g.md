# Coarticulation Study: /k/ + /g/

### Sequence: voiceless velar stop → voiced velar stop

### Example Phrase: **back garden**

**IPA:** `/bæk̚ ˈɡɑɹdən/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bæk̚ ˈɡɑɹdən[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"back garden"** slowly and notice how **/k/** flows into **/g/**. Both sounds share the same velar place of articulation, but differ in their manner, creating a smooth homorganic transition.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "back | garden," then blend: "back‑garden."
* Freeze on the **/k/**: establish clear tongue back contacts soft palate, then feel the shift toward **/g/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/bæk̚ ˈɡɑɹdən/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[bæk̚̚ ˈɡɑɹdən[`

  * **[k̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/g/** early, so **/k/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiceless to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/k/** may go unreleased **[k̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/g/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Say "back garden" with a big pause between **/k/** and **/g/** (fully releasing **/k/**). Then say it naturally without the pause. You'll hear how the release disappears in fluent speech.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/k/** and **/g/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |
| Second | /g/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short, often reduced finally |

* **/k/**: Homorganic: velar place maintained
* **/g/**: Voiced velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

2. **Stop Release Overlap:**
   The /k/ is typically unreleased ([k̚]), with air pressure maintained until the /g/ closure forms. The release burst belongs to /g/.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Homorganic: velar place maintained

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /k/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /g/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"back"** slowly, establishing full /k/ articulation.
2. Say **"garden"** starting with an isolated /g/.
3. Merge: *back garden* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bæk̚ ˈɡɑɹdən/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /k/ and /g/.
* Alternate "k-g-k-g" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → velar                         | /k g/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /k g/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → stop                           | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving stop (plosive) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /k/ + /g/ is a **mixed-voicing, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **voicing transition**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
