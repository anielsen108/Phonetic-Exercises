# Coarticulation Study: /d/ + /h/

### Sequence: voiced alveolar stop → voiceless glottal fricative

### Example Phrase: **had hoped**

**IPA:** `/hæd̥̚ hoʊ̯pt/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[hæd̥̚ hoʊ̯pt[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"had hoped"** slowly and notice how **/d/** prepares for **/h/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from alveolar to glottal position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "had | hoped," then blend: "had‑hoped."
* Freeze on the **/d/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, then feel the shift toward **/h/** (open glottis).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/hæd̥̚ hoʊ̯pt/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[hæd̥̚̚ hoʊ̯pt[`

  * **[d̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/h/** early, so **/d/** begins shifting toward the glottal target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward glottal, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/d/** may go unreleased **[d̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/h/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "had hoped" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/d/** to **/h/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/d/** and **/h/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /d/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | variable, flapped intervocalically |
| Second | /h/ | glottal | fricative | voiceless | oral | brief, anticipates following vowel |

* **/d/**: Devoicing + breathy glottal onset
* **/h/**: Voiceless glottal fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the glottal target before the /d/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and glottal articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /d/ closure releases directly into the /h/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Devoicing + breathy glottal onset

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /h/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"had"** slowly, establishing full /d/ articulation.
2. Say **"hoped"** starting with an isolated /h/.
3. Merge: *had hoped* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/hæd̥̚ hoʊ̯pt/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /d/ and /h/.
* Alternate "d-h-d-h" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → glottal                    | /d h/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /d h/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → fricative                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and fricative manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /d/ + /h/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
