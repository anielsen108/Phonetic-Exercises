# Coarticulation Study: /h/ + /k/

### Sequence: voiceless glottal fricative → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **he came**

**IPA:** `/hi kʰeɪm/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[hi kʰeɪm[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"he came"** slowly and feel how **/h/** begins shifting toward **/k/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/h/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "he | came," then blend: "he‑came."
* Freeze on the **/h/**: establish clear open glottis, then feel the shift toward **/k/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/hi kʰeɪm/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[hi kʰeɪm[`

  * **Coarticulation** = articulators prepare for **[k]** during **[h]**

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/k/** early, so **/h/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the glottal articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "he came" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/h/-/k/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/h/** and **/k/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /h/ | glottal | fricative | voiceless | oral | brief, anticipates following vowel |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/h/**: Glottal → velar stop
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /h/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between glottal and velar articulations.

2. **Fricative-to-Stop Transition:**
   The continuous airflow of /h/ terminates as the /k/ closure forms. Listeners perceive a sharp acoustic boundary.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Glottal → velar stop

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /h/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Frication noise         | Continuous aperiodic energy                 | Distinct fricative quality      |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"he"** slowly, establishing full /h/ articulation.
2. Say **"came"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *he came* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/hi kʰeɪm/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /h/ and /k/.
* Alternate "h-k-h-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | glottal → velar                       | /h k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiceless                | Common in /h k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → stop                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving fricative and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /h/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
