# Coarticulation Study: /p/ + /n/

### Sequence: voiceless bilabial stop → alveolar nasal

### Example Phrase: **stop now**

**IPA:** `/stɑp̚ naʊ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[stɑp̚ naʊ[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"stop now"** slowly and notice how **/p/** prepares for **/n/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from bilabial to alveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "stop | now," then blend: "stop‑now."
* Freeze on the **/p/**: establish clear lips close, then feel the shift toward **/n/** (tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, velum lowers).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/stɑp̚ naʊ/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[stɑp̚̚ naʊ[`

  * **[p̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/n/** early, so **/p/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the bilabial articulation moves toward alveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiceless to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/p/** may go unreleased **[p̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/n/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "stop now" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/p/** to **/n/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/p/** and **/n/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /p/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often aspirated word-initially |
| Second | /n/ | alveolar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/p/**: Bilabial → alveolar nasal
* **/n/**: Alveolar nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /p/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between bilabial and alveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /p/ closure releases directly into the /n/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

5. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Bilabial → alveolar nasal

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /p/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /n/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"stop"** slowly, establishing full /p/ articulation.
2. Say **"now"** starting with an isolated /n/.
3. Merge: *stop now* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/stɑp̚ naʊ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /p/ and /n/.
* Alternate "p-n-p-n" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | bilabial → alveolar                   | /p n/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /p n/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → nasal                          | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /p/ + /n/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
