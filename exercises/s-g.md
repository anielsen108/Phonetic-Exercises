# Coarticulation Study: /s/ + /g/

### Sequence: voiceless alveolar fricative → voiced velar stop

### Example Phrase: **this guy**

**IPA:** `/ðɪz ɡaɪ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[ðɪz ɡaɪ[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"this guy"** slowly and feel how **/s/** begins shifting toward **/g/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/s/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "this | guy," then blend: "this‑guy."
* Freeze on the **/s/**: establish clear tongue tip near alveolar ridge, then feel the shift toward **/g/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/ðɪz ɡaɪ/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[ðɪz ɡaɪ[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/g/** early, so **/s/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiceless to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "this guy" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/s/** to **/g/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/s/** and **/g/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /s/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiceless | oral | continuous, high-energy |
| Second | /g/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short, often reduced finally |

* **/s/**: Voiced fricative → voiced stop
* **/g/**: Voiced velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /s/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Fricative-to-Stop Transition:**
   The continuous airflow of /s/ terminates as the /g/ closure forms. Listeners perceive a sharp acoustic boundary.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Voiced fricative → voiced stop

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /s/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Frication noise         | Continuous aperiodic energy                 | Distinct fricative quality      |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /g/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"this"** slowly, establishing full /s/ articulation.
2. Say **"guy"** starting with an isolated /g/.
3. Merge: *this guy* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/ðɪz ɡaɪ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /s/ and /g/.
* Alternate "s-g-s-g" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → velar                      | /s g/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /s g/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → stop                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving fricative (sibilant) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /s/ + /g/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
