# Coarticulation Study: /p/ + /f/

### Sequence: voiceless bilabial stop → voiceless labiodental fricative

### Example Phrase: **stop fighting**

**IPA:** `/stɑp̚ ˈfaɪɾɪŋ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[stɑp̚ ˈfaɪɾɪŋ[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /p/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often aspirated word-initially |
| Second | /f/ | labiodental | fricative | voiceless | oral | continuous, variable length |

* **/p/**: Bilabial → labiodental
* **/f/**: Voiceless labiodental fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the labiodental target before the /p/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between bilabial and labiodental articulations.

2. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /p/ closure releases directly into the /f/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Bilabial → labiodental

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /p/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /f/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"stop"** slowly, establishing full /p/ articulation.
2. Say **"fighting"** starting with an isolated /f/.
3. Merge: *stop fighting* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/stɑp̚ ˈfaɪɾɪŋ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /p/ and /f/.
* Alternate "p-f-p-f" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | bilabial → labiodental                | /p f/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiceless                | Common in /p f/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → fricative                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and fricative manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /p/ + /f/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
