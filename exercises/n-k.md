# Coarticulation Study: /n/ + /k/

### Sequence: alveolar nasal → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **in class**

**IPA:** `/ɪn kʰlæs/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[ɪn kʰlæs[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"in class"** slowly and feel how **/n/** begins shifting toward **/k/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/n/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "in | class," then blend: "in‑class."
* Freeze on the **/n/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, velum lowers, then feel the shift toward **/k/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/ɪn kʰlæs/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[ɪn kʰlæs[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/k/** early, so **/n/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "in class" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/n/** to **/k/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/n/** and **/k/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /n/ | alveolar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/n/**: Alveolar → velar
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /n/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Alveolar → velar

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Nasal formants          | Low F1 (~250 Hz), distinct nasal pole       | Nasal resonance quality         |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"in"** slowly, establishing full /n/ articulation.
2. Say **"class"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *in class* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/ɪn kʰlæs/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /n/ and /k/.
* Alternate "n-k-n-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → velar                      | /n k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /n k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | nasal → stop                          | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving nasal and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /n/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
