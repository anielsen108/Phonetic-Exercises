# Coarticulation Study: /n/ + /v/

### Sequence: alveolar nasal → voiced labiodental fricative

### Example Phrase: **in very**

**IPA:** `/ɪn ˈvɛɹi/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[ɪn ˈvɛɹi[`

## Introductory Drill

Say **"in very"** slowly and notice how **/n/** prepares for **/v/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from alveolar to labiodental position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "in | very," then blend: "in‑very."
* Freeze on the **/n/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, velum lowers, then feel the shift toward **/v/** (lower lip touches upper teeth).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/ɪn ˈvɛɹi/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[ɪn ˈvɛɹi[`

  * **Coarticulation** = articulators prepare for **[v]** during **[n]**

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/v/** early, so **/n/** begins shifting toward the labiodental target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward labiodental, creating a smooth transition.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "in very" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/n/-/v/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/n/** and **/v/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /n/ | alveolar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |
| Second | /v/ | labiodental | fricative | voiced | oral | continuous, may devoice finally |

* **/n/**: Nasal → voiced fricative
* **/v/**: Voiced labiodental fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the labiodental target before the /n/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and labiodental articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /n/ and /v/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Nasal → voiced fricative

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Nasal formants          | Low F1 (~250 Hz), distinct nasal pole       | Nasal resonance quality         |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /v/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"in"** slowly, establishing full /n/ articulation.
2. Say **"very"** starting with an isolated /v/.
3. Merge: *in very* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/ɪn ˈvɛɹi/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /n/ and /v/.
* Alternate "n-v-n-v" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → labiodental                | /n v/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /n v/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | nasal → fricative                     | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving nasal and fricative manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /n/ + /v/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
