# Coarticulation Study: /st/ + /n/

### Sequence: fricative + stop cluster → alveolar nasal

### Example Phrase: **first name**

**IPA:** `/fɝst̚ neɪm/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[fɝst̚ neɪm[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"first name"** slowly and notice how **/st/** prepares for **/n/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from st to alveolar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "first | name," then blend: "first‑name."
* Freeze on the **/st/**: establish clear st articulation, then feel the shift toward **/n/** (tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, velum lowers).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/fɝst̚ neɪm/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[fɝst̚ neɪm[`

  * **[st̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from X to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/n/** early, so **/st/** begins shifting toward the alveolar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the st articulation moves toward alveolar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from X to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "first name" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/st/** to **/n/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/st/** and **/n/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /st/ | alveolar | fricative + stop | voiceless | oral | common cluster |
| Second | /n/ | alveolar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/st/**: Cluster → alveolar nasal
* **/n/**: Alveolar nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

2. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /st/ closure releases directly into the /n/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

3. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Cluster → alveolar nasal

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /st/             | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /n/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"first"** slowly, establishing full /st/ articulation.
2. Say **"name"** starting with an isolated /n/.
3. Merge: *first name* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/fɝst̚ neɪm/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /st/ and /n/.
* Alternate "st-n-st-n" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → alveolar                   | /st n/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /st n/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → nasal                     | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving fricative + stop and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /st/ + /n/ is a **mixed-voicing, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **voicing transition**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
