# Coarticulation Study: /nst/ + /z/

### Sequence: nasal + fricative + stop cluster → voiced alveolar fricative

### Example Phrase: **against zealots**

**IPA:** `/əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈzɛləts/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈzɛləts[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /nst/ | nasal-alveolar-alveolar | nasal + fricative + stop | voiced then voiceless | nasal then oral | complex cluster |
| Second | /z/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiced | oral | continuous, may devoice |

* **/nst/**: Voicing contrast: /t/ to /z/ with voicing onset during sibilant
* **/z/**: Voiced alveolar fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the alveolar target before the /nst/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between nasal-alveolar-alveolar and alveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced then voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /nst/ closure releases directly into the /z/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

5. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Voicing contrast: /t/ to /z/ with voicing onset during sibilant

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /nst/            | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /z/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"against"** slowly, establishing full /nst/ articulation.
2. Say **"zealots"** starting with an isolated /z/.
3. Merge: *against zealots* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈzɛləts/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /nst/ and /z/.
* Alternate "nst-z-nst-z" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | nasal-alveolar-alveolar → alveolar    | /nst z/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced then voiceless to voiced       | Common in /nst z/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | nasal → fricative                     | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving nasal + fricative + stop and fricative (sibilant) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /nst/ + /z/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
