# Coarticulation Study: /k/ + /m/

### Sequence: voiceless velar stop → bilabial nasal

### Example Phrase: **black market**

**IPA:** `/blæk̚ ˈmɑɹkɪt/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[blæk̚ ˈmɑɹkɪt[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"black market"** slowly and notice how **/k/** prepares for **/m/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from velar to bilabial position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "black | market," then blend: "black‑market."
* Freeze on the **/k/**: establish clear tongue back contacts soft palate, then feel the shift toward **/m/** (lips close, velum lowers).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/blæk̚ ˈmɑɹkɪt/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[blæk̚̚ ˈmɑɹk̚ɪt[`

  * **[k̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/m/** early, so **/k/** begins shifting toward the bilabial target.
* **Place assimilation:** the velar articulation moves toward bilabial, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiceless to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.
* **Release economy:** **/k/** may go unreleased **[k̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/m/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "black market" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/k/** to **/m/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/k/** and **/m/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |
| Second | /m/ | bilabial | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/k/**: Oral → nasal with place change
* **/m/**: Bilabial nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the bilabial target before the /k/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between velar and bilabial articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /k/ closure releases directly into the /m/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

5. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Oral → nasal with place change

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /k/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /m/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"black"** slowly, establishing full /k/ articulation.
2. Say **"market"** starting with an isolated /m/.
3. Merge: *black market* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/blæk̚ ˈmɑɹkɪt/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /k/ and /m/.
* Alternate "k-m-k-m" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → bilabial                      | /k m/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /k m/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → nasal                          | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /k/ + /m/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
