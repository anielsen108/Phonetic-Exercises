# Coarticulation Study: /d/ + /g/

### Sequence: voiced alveolar stop → voiced velar stop

### Example Phrase: **bad guy**

**IPA:** `/bæd̚ ɡaɪ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bæd̚ ɡaɪ[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"bad guy"** slowly and feel how **/d/** begins shifting toward **/g/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/d/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "bad | guy," then blend: "bad‑guy."
* Freeze on the **/d/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, then feel the shift toward **/g/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/bæd̚ ɡaɪ/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[bæd̚̚ ɡaɪ[`

  * **[d̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/g/** early, so **/d/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Release economy:** **/d/** may go unreleased **[d̚]**, with articulators moving directly to **/g/** position.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Say "bad guy" with a big pause between **/d/** and **/g/** (fully releasing **/d/**). Then say it naturally without the pause. You'll hear how the release disappears in fluent speech.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/d/** and **/g/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /d/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | variable, flapped intervocalically |
| Second | /g/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short, often reduced finally |

* **/d/**: Voiced sequence maintained: both stops fully voiced
* **/g/**: Voiced velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /d/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /d/ and /g/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

3. **Stop Release Overlap:**
   The /d/ is typically unreleased ([d̚]), with air pressure maintained until the /g/ closure forms. The release burst belongs to /g/.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Voiced sequence maintained: both stops fully voiced

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /g/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"bad"** slowly, establishing full /d/ articulation.
2. Say **"guy"** starting with an isolated /g/.
3. Merge: *bad guy* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bæd̚ ɡaɪ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /d/ and /g/.
* Alternate "d-g-d-g" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → velar                      | /d g/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /d g/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → stop                           | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /d/ + /g/ is a **voiced, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
