# Coarticulation Study: /g/ + /p/

### Sequence: voiced velar stop → voiceless bilabial stop

### Example Phrase: **big problem**

**IPA:** `/bɪɡ̊̚ ˈpʰɹɑbləm/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bɪɡ̊̚ ˈpʰɹɑbləm[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /g/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short, often reduced finally |
| Second | /p/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often aspirated word-initially |

* **/g/**: Devoiced /g̊/ before voiceless stop
* **/p/**: Voiceless bilabial stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

---

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the bilabial target before the /g/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between velar and bilabial articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Overlap:**
   The /g/ is typically unreleased ([g̚]), with air pressure maintained until the /p/ closure forms. The release burst belongs to /p/.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Devoiced /g̊/ before voiceless stop

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /p/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"big"** slowly, establishing full /g/ articulation.
2. Say **"problem"** starting with an isolated /p/.
3. Merge: *big problem* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bɪɡ̊̚ ˈpʰɹɑbləm/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /g/ and /p/.
* Alternate "g-p-g-p" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → bilabial                      | /g p/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /g p/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → stop                           | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /g/ + /p/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
