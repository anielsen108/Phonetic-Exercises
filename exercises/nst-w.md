# Coarticulation Study: /nst/ + /w/

### Sequence: nasal + fricative + stop cluster → labial-velar approximant

### Example Phrase: **against wishes**

**IPA:** `/əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈwɪʃɪz/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈwɪʃɪz[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"against wishes"** slowly and notice how **/nst/** prepares for **/w/**. You'll feel the articulators shifting from nst to labial-velar position, creating a smooth transition between the two sounds.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "against | wishes," then blend: "against‑wishes."
* Freeze on the **/nst/**: establish clear nst articulation, then feel the shift toward **/w/** (lips round, tongue back raises).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈwɪʃɪz/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈwɪʃɪz[`

  * **[nst̚]** = unreleased stop before word boundary or next consonant
  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from X to voiced

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/w/** early, so **/nst/** begins shifting toward the labial-velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the nst articulation moves toward labial-velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from X to voiced may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "against wishes" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/nst/** to **/w/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/nst/** and **/w/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /nst/ | nasal-alveolar-alveolar | nasal + fricative + stop | voiced then voiceless | nasal then oral | complex cluster |
| Second | /w/ | labial-velar | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |

* **/nst/**: Lip rounding begins during /t/ closure
* **/w/**: Labial-velar approximant articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the labial-velar target before the /nst/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between nasal-alveolar-alveolar and labial-velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced then voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /nst/ closure releases directly into the /w/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

5. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Lip rounding begins during /t/ closure

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /nst/            | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /w/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"against"** slowly, establishing full /nst/ articulation.
2. Say **"wishes"** starting with an isolated /w/.
3. Merge: *against wishes* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/əˈɡɛnst̚ ˈwɪʃɪz/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /nst/ and /w/.
* Alternate "nst-w-nst-w" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | nasal-alveolar-alveolar → labial-velar | /nst w/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced then voiceless to voiced       | Common in /nst w/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | nasal → approximant                   | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving nasal + fricative + stop and approximant manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /nst/ + /w/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
