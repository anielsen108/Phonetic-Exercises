## Practice Exercises

### Example 1
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 1 - rθ+ps]
**IPA:** `/...rθps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /ps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishFocus on the transition from approximant + voiceless dental fricative to voiceless bilabial stop + voiceless alveolar fricative.

---

### Example 2
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 2 - rθ+ps]
**IPA:** `/...rθps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /ps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishPractice in connected speech across word boundaries.
