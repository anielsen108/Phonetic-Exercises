## Practice Exercises

### Example 1
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 1 - θ+rps]
**IPA:** `/...θrps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /rps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishFocus on the transition from voiceless dental fricative to approximant + voiceless bilabial stop + voiceless alveolar fricative.

---

### Example 2
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 2 - θ+rps]
**IPA:** `/...θrps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /rps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishPractice in connected speech across word boundaries.

---

### Example 3
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 3 - θ+rps]
**IPA:** `/...θrps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /rps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishMaintain natural timing and rhythm.
