# Coarticulation Study: /k/ + /dʒ/

### Sequence: voiceless velar stop → voiced postalveolar affricate

### Example Phrase: **back job**

**IPA:** `/bæk̥̚ d͡ʒɑb/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[bæk̥̚ d͡ʒɑb[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |
| Second | /dʒ/ | postalveolar | affricate | voiced | oral | stop + fricative sequence |

* **/k/**: Slight devoicing of /dʒ/
* **/dʒ/**: Voiced postalveolar affricate articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the postalveolar target before the /k/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between velar and postalveolar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /k/ closure releases directly into the /dʒ/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Slight devoicing of /dʒ/

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /k/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /dʒ/                    | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"back"** slowly, establishing full /k/ articulation.
2. Say **"job"** starting with an isolated /dʒ/.
3. Merge: *back job* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/bæk̥̚ d͡ʒɑb/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /k/ and /dʒ/.
* Alternate "k-dʒ-k-dʒ" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | velar → postalveolar                  | /k dʒ/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /k dʒ/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → affricate                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and affricate manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /k/ + /dʒ/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
