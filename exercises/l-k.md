# Coarticulation Study: /l/ + /k/

### Sequence: alveolar lateral approximant → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **milk**

**IPA:** `/mɪɫk/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[mɪɫk[`

---

## Introductory Drill

Say **"milk"** slowly and feel how **/l/** begins shifting toward **/k/**. The tongue back starts rising toward the velum (soft palate) while the **/l/** articulation is still completing, creating anticipatory coarticulation.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "milk," then blend: "milk."
* Freeze on the **/l/**: establish clear tongue tip contacts alveolar ridge, air flows laterally, then feel the shift toward **/k/** (tongue back contacts soft palate).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/mɪɫk/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[mɪɫk[`

  * **Voicing transition** = glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/k/** early, so **/l/** begins shifting toward the velar target.
* **Place assimilation:** the alveolar articulation moves toward velar, creating a smooth transition.
* **Voicing adjustment:** the shift from voiced to voiceless may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Hum gently while saying "milk" to track voicing. Notice where your vocal folds stop/start vibrating as you move from **/l/** to **/k/**.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/l/** and **/k/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /l/ | alveolar | lateral approximant | voiced | oral (lateral) | continuous, velarized finally |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/l/**: Velarized lateral before velar
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /l/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Velarized lateral before velar

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"milk"** slowly, establishing full /l/ articulation.
2. Say **"k"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *milk* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/mɪɫk/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /l/ and /k/.
* Alternate "l-k-l-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → velar                      | /l k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /l k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | lateral → stop                        | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving lateral approximant and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /l/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
