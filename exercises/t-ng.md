# Coarticulation Study: /t/ + /ŋ/

### Sequence: voiceless alveolar stop → velar nasal

### Example Phrase: **at Nguyen's**

**IPA:** `/æt̚ ŋwiənz/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[æt̚ ŋwiənz[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /t/ | alveolar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, often unreleased word-finally |
| Second | /ŋ/ | velar | nasal | voiced | nasal | continuous resonant |

* **/t/**: Rare word-initial /ŋ/ in Vietnamese names
* **/ŋ/**: Velar nasal articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /t/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between alveolar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /t/ closure releases directly into the /ŋ/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

4. **Nasal Coarticulation:**
   Velum movement coordinates with oral articulation. Nasal airflow may extend into or anticipate the adjacent segment.

5. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Rare word-initial /ŋ/ in Vietnamese names

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /t/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /ŋ/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"at"** slowly, establishing full /t/ articulation.
2. Say **"Nguyen's"** starting with an isolated /ŋ/.
3. Merge: *at Nguyen's* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/æt̚ ŋwiənz/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /t/ and /ŋ/.
* Alternate "t-ŋ-t-ŋ" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → velar                      | /t ŋ/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /t ŋ/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | stop → nasal                          | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving stop (plosive) and nasal manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /t/ + /ŋ/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
