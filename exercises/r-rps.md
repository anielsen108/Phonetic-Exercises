### Example 1
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 1 - r+rps]
**IPA:** `/...rrps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /rps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishFocus on the transition from alveolar approximant to approximant + voiceless bilabial stop + voiceless alveolar fricative.

### Example 2
**Phrase:** [Example phrase 2 - r+rps]
**IPA:** `/...rrps.../  `

**Notes:** Note: /rps/ rarely occurs in word-initial position in EnglishPractice in connected speech across word boundaries.
