# Coarticulation Study: /w/ + /k/

### Sequence: labial-velar approximant → voiceless velar stop

### Example Phrase: **now call**

**IPA:** `/naʊ kʰɔl/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[naʊ kʰɔl[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /w/ | labial-velar | approximant | voiced | oral | brief glide |
| Second | /k/ | velar | stop (plosive) | voiceless | oral | short, aspirated in stressed onsets |

* **/w/**: Labiovelar → velar
* **/k/**: Voiceless velar stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the velar target before the /w/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between labial-velar and velar articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiced to voiceless. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Labiovelar → velar

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /k/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"now"** slowly, establishing full /w/ articulation.
2. Say **"call"** starting with an isolated /k/.
3. Merge: *now call* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/naʊ kʰɔl/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /w/ and /k/.
* Alternate "w-k-w-k" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | labial-velar → velar                  | /w k/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiceless                   | Common in /w k/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | approximant → stop                    | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving approximant and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /w/ + /k/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
