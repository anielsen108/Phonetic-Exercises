# Coarticulation Study: /h/ + /b/

### Sequence: voiceless glottal fricative → voiced bilabial stop

### Example Phrase: **he bought**

**IPA:** `/hi bɔt/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[hi bɔt[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /h/ | glottal | fricative | voiceless | oral | brief, anticipates following vowel |
| Second | /b/ | bilabial | stop (plosive) | voiced | oral | short closure, often unreleased |

* **/h/**: Glottal → voiced bilabial
* **/b/**: Voiced bilabial stop articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Anticipatory Place Shift:**
   The tongue/lips begin moving toward the bilabial target before the /h/ gesture completes. This creates overlap between glottal and bilabial articulations.

2. **Voicing Transition:**
   The glottis shifts from voiceless to voiced. This transition may show partial devoicing or voicing anticipation depending on speech rate.

3. **Fricative-to-Stop Transition:**
   The continuous airflow of /h/ terminates as the /b/ closure forms. Listeners perceive a sharp acoustic boundary.

4. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Glottal → voiced bilabial

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /h/              | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Frication noise         | Continuous aperiodic energy                 | Distinct fricative quality      |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /b/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"he"** slowly, establishing full /h/ articulation.
2. Say **"bought"** starting with an isolated /b/.
3. Merge: *he bought* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/hi bɔt/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /h/ and /b/.
* Alternate "h-b-h-b" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | glottal → bilabial                    | /h b/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiced                   | Common in /h b/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → stop                      | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all cross-place sequences involving fricative and stop (plosive) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /h/ + /b/ is a **mixed-voicing, cross-place sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **anticipatory place shift**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
