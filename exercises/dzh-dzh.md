# Coarticulation Study: /dʒ/ + /dʒ/

### Sequence: voiced postalveolar affricate → voiced postalveolar affricate

### Example Phrase: **large judge**

**IPA:** `/lɑɹd͡ʒ d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[lɑɹd͡ʒ d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ[`

## Introductory Drill

Say **"large judge"** slowly and notice how **/dʒ/** flows into **/dʒ/**. Both sounds share the same postalveolar place of articulation, but differ in their manner, creating a smooth homorganic transition.

🗣️ **What to do**

* Speak it in slow motion: "large | judge," then blend: "large‑judge."
* Freeze on the **/dʒ/**: establish clear tongue releases into ʒ, then feel the shift toward **/dʒ/** (tongue releases into ʒ).
* Repeat in three tempos: whisper → comfortable → projected.
* Add three intentions: confidential, neutral, declarative-authoritative.

📌 **Tight IPA (Neutral Broadcast GA)**

* Broad: `/lɑɹd͡ʒ d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ/`
* Narrow (coarticulation shown): `[lɑɹd͡ʒ d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ[`

  * **Coarticulation** = articulators prepare for **[dʒ]** during **[dʒ]**

🔎 **What you're noticing (plain English)**

* **Anticipatory coarticulation:** your brain preps **/dʒ/** early, so **/dʒ/** begins shifting toward the postalveolar target.

🎧 **Mini-experiment (no gear required)**

* Record yourself saying "large judge" at three speeds: slow, medium, fast. Listen for how the **/dʒ/-/dʒ/** transition becomes smoother and more overlapped at faster tempos.

🎼 **Performance tweak**

* For clarity: maintain distinct **/dʒ/** and **/dʒ/** articulations—crisp, news-reader polish.
* For intimacy: let the articulations blend and overlap more—warmer, more conversational flow.

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /dʒ/ | postalveolar | affricate | voiced | oral | stop + fricative sequence |
| Second | /dʒ/ | postalveolar | affricate | voiced | oral | stop + fricative sequence |

* **/dʒ/**: Voiced affricate sequence
* **/dʒ/**: Voiced postalveolar affricate articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Voicing Continuity:**
   Both /dʒ/ and /dʒ/ are voiced; the glottis remains adducted throughout. Spectrographically, this appears as a continuous low-frequency voicing bar.

2. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Voiced affricate sequence

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Voicing bar             | Low-frequency band (~100 Hz) throughout     | Smooth, connected transition    |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /dʒ/                    | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"large"** slowly, establishing full /dʒ/ articulation.
2. Say **"judge"** starting with an isolated /dʒ/.
3. Merge: *large judge* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/lɑɹd͡ʒ d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /dʒ/ and /dʒ/.
* Alternate "dʒ-dʒ-dʒ-dʒ" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | postalveolar → postalveolar           | /dʒ dʒ/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiced to voiced                      | Common in /dʒ dʒ/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | affricate → affricate                 | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving affricate and affricate manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /dʒ/ + /dʒ/ is a **voiced, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **voicing continuity**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
