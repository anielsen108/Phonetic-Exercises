# Coarticulation Study: /st/ + /s/

### Sequence: fricative + stop cluster → voiceless alveolar fricative

### Example Phrase: **first sign**

**IPA:** `/fɝst̚ saɪn/`
**Allophonic detail:** `[fɝst̚ saɪn[`

## 1. Segmental Foundations

| Segment | Symbol | Place | Manner | Voicing | Airflow | Duration |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First | /st/ | alveolar | fricative + stop | voiceless | oral | common cluster |
| Second | /s/ | alveolar | fricative (sibilant) | voiceless | oral | continuous, high-energy |

* **/st/**: Cluster → sibilant
* **/s/**: Voiceless alveolar fricative articulation follows with typical place and manner characteristics.

## 2. Coarticulatory Mechanisms

1. **Stop Release Modification:**
   The /st/ closure releases directly into the /s/ articulation, often showing reduced or absent burst energy.

2. **Specific Adaptation:**
   Cluster → sibilant

## 3. Acoustic & Perceptual Signature

| Feature                 | Acoustic Manifestation                      | Perceptual Effect               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Aspiration/noise        | High-frequency energy from /st/             | Clear fricative or burst cue    |
| Closure gap             | Silent interval (20-80 ms)                  | Perceived stop identity         |
| Burst/release           | Brief high-amplitude transient              | Place-of-articulation cue       |
| Formant transitions     | F2/F3 movement into /s/                     | Place identification cue        |

## 4. Articulatory Practice

### 4.1 Slow-Motion Drill

1. Say **"first"** slowly, establishing full /st/ articulation.
2. Say **"sign"** starting with an isolated /s/.
3. Merge: *first sign* — maintain voicing continuity, minimize release between segments.
4. Record and compare:

   * Over-released: Excessive separation between sounds
   * Balanced: Natural liaison as transcribed `/fɝst̚ saɪn/`
   * Under-articulated: Loss of primary articulatory cues

### 4.2 Gestural Continuity Exercise

* Focus awareness on active articulators for both /st/ and /s/.
* Alternate "st-s-st-s" while maintaining voicing where applicable.
* Notice the articulatory transition: where does one gesture end and the next begin?
* Perform slowly, then gradually increase speed while preserving clarity.
* The movement should feel **fluid** and **economical**, not **segmented**.

## 5. Broader Coarticulatory Insights

| Type                           | Manifestation                         | Similar Pairs       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Place shift                 ** | alveolar → alveolar                   | /st s/, similar front-back transitions |
| **Voicing pattern             ** | voiceless to voiceless                | Common in /st s/ sequences |
| **Manner transition           ** | fricative → fricative                 | Affects timing and release |


Understanding this combination helps refine articulation for all homorganic sequences involving fricative + stop and fricative (sibilant) manners.

## 6. Summary Points

* /st/ + /s/ is a **mixed-voicing, homorganic sequence** showing distinctive coarticulatory patterns.
* The transition exhibits **stop release modification**.
* Perceptually, listeners rely on **formant transitions and temporal cues** to identify both segments.
* Mastery involves **smooth articulatory flow** while maintaining segment identity.
